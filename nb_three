1. Initialize three counters:
   - `length_counter = 0` (to count the total number of characters, excluding the final point)
   - `word_counter = 1` (start at 1 because the sentence has at least one word if it's not empty)
   - `vowel_counter = 0` (to count the vowels in the sentence)

2. Read the sentence character by character.

3. For each character:
   - If the character is not a point:
     - Increment `length_counter` by 1.
     - If the character is a space:
       - Increment `word_counter` by 1 (assuming each space separates words).
     - If the character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), increment `vowel_counter` by 1.
   
4. Stop processing once the point is reached (ignore the point character).

5. Output the values of:
   - `length_counter`
   - `word_counter`
   - `vowel_counter`
